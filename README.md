Hi! I'm amphirian but some call me amphy!<br />
This github will be a consolidation of all the projects I have made and am planning to make.<br />
If you have any suggestions or improvements for my projects do drop me a message! (You can find my contact details in my profile section)

<!---
amphirian/amphirian is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
